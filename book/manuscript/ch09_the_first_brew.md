# 9. The First Brew

Everything's built. Now the moment of truth: we train the model for the first time and
watch what happens.

This chapter is deliberately unheroic. The goal isn't a triumphant result — it's to
confirm the loop works and to see the model's honest behavior as it learns. Think of
it as the first time you run a recipe you've been assembling: you're not hoping for a
masterpiece, you're checking that the oven works and nothing explodes.

## The data

1400 generated tasks: a natural-language specification paired with its reference
Python program. The model's job is to read the spec and produce the code.

## Training

We train with a standard next-token objective: the model sees the prompt and the
reference program as one sequence, and learns to predict each token given the ones
before it. We use AdamW, batch size 16, learning rate 1e-3, for 1500 steps.

The training loss descends smoothly:

```
step    0   loss 5.84
step  200   loss 0.029
step  400   loss 0.022
step  600   loss 0.023
step  800   loss 0.020
step 1000   loss 0.021
step 1200   loss 0.019
step 1499   loss 0.019
```

That is a large, clean drop — from 5.84 to 0.019 in 1500 steps. A loss that low means
the model can predict the next token of this (prompt, program) sequence almost
perfectly on the training set.

## The honest caveat

A falling training loss — and even a very low one — is *not* evidence of learning. We
saw this in the pilot and it is the book's recurring motif. The training loss tells us
the model fits the training data. It does not tell us it can *generalize* to unseen
problems, or that it learned the computation rather than the surface form.

So after training, the only losses that matter are the *held-out* ones: how well does
the model do on problems it never saw? That is Chapter 10's question, and the answer
there is the real measurement of this brew.

## What this chapter establishes

This first brew is not a result; it is a proof of the loop. We have:

- trained a real model on real data,
- watched its loss descend smoothly,
- saved a checkpoint,
- confirmed that we can take the trained model and produce code for a new prompt,
  run it through the sandbox, and score it with the judge.

That loop — generate data, train, generate code, execute, score — is the laboratory
working end-to-end. It is the foundation everything else stands on. The model is
built. Now we have to find out what it actually learned.
